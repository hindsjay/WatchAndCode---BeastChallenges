Solution for beast challenge #4 - Creating Libraries Out of Order

A continuation from the previous beast challenge, our task is to write a program where a library is created before it's dependencies.  We are to make sure the callback function for each library is run only once.

Tests were run and passed to ensure all requirements are met.  Testing library based on the tinytest.js library.
