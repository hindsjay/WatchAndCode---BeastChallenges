Solution for beast challenge #6 (https://github.com/gordonmzhu/beasts/issues/7) - A twist on accounting.toFixed

Task is to write toFixed method that does the same thing as toFixed method found in AccountingJS, but do this using string manipulation (cannot use multiplcation or exponential notation).

Tests were run and passed to ensure all requirements are met.  Testing library based on the tinytest.js library.
